    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken Alfredo is a type of pasta, often fettuccine, topped with a creamy cheese and butter sauce. The dish is
        named after Alfredo di Lelio, who featured the dish at his restaurant in Rome in the early to mid-20th century.
        The "Alfredo sauce" is a simple cream sauce that is often made with butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese.
        The sauce is usually served over fettuccine noodles and is often topped with chicken or another protein.

        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>

        <li>Slice the cooked chicken into strips and add it back to the skillet along with the cooked fettuccine pasta.
