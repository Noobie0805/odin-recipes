    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>
        An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apple. It is often served with whipped cream,
        ice cream, or cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the
        upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). A traditional British apple pie has a
        bottom crust, but not a top crust; this is a "tart". The English style of apple pie recipe usually calls for
        a shortcrust pastry, as opposed to the American style of pie, which calls for a flaky pastry. The apple pie is
        a traditional dish in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and Sweden.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package of double-crust pie dough (or homemade crust)</li>
        <li>6-7 medium apples (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp recommended)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter (cut into small pieces)</li>
        <li>1 egg (beaten, for egg wash)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse sugar (optional, for topping)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
        <li>Peel, core, and slice the apples into 1/4-inch thick slices. Place them in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4
            teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons flour to the apples. Toss to combine evenly.</li>
        <li>Roll out one of the pie doughs and fit it into a 9-inch pie dish.</li>
        <li>Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust, arranging it evenly. Dot the filling with small pieces of butter.
        </li>
        <li>Roll out the second pie dough and place it over the apples. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges
            together to seal the pie.</li>
        <li>Brush the top crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar, if desired. Cut a few small slits in
            the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is
            bubbling.</li>
        <li>If the edges of the crust brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil halfway through the baking
            process.</li>
        <li>Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for at least 2 hours before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>


    Enjoy your apple pie!
